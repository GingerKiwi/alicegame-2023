# alicegame-2023
Hacktoberfest 2023 version of The Alice in Wonderland Project

**October 03, 2023:**
Teams are being organized. 
So far we have two full teams:
- Asia01 and Americas01
- Each team has 2 co-team leads, and 6 contributors/ new devs.
- There's a long wait list. 

I'm still looking for 2-4 more maintainers/ co-team leads.

Also note that _**I'm (Liz/GingerKiwi) sick for the first time in 22 months, so things are starting slower than I'd like, but we're still good to go.**_
